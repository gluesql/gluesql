# Transaction

Transactions in SQL are a series of queries that are executed as a single unit of work. In GlueSQL, transactions help to ensure the consistency and integrity of the database. They follow the ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

**Note: In GlueSQL, transactions are an optional feature. Support for transactions depends on the storage engine being used. Currently, only `SledStorage` supports transactions, but there are plans to add support for other storage engines in the future. Transaction isolation levels may also vary depending on the storage engine. For example, the current transaction isolation level for `SledStorage` is SNAPSHOT ISOLATION.**

## BEGIN TRANSACTION

To start a new transaction, use the `BEGIN` keyword:

```
BEGIN;
```

## COMMIT TRANSACTION

To permanently save the changes made during the transaction, use the `COMMIT` keyword:

```
COMMIT;
```

## ROLLBACK TRANSACTION

To undo the changes made during the transaction and revert the database to its state before the transaction started, use the `ROLLBACK` keyword:

```
ROLLBACK;
```

## Example

Consider the following table `TxTest` with columns `id` (INTEGER) and `name` (TEXT):

```sql
CREATE TABLE TxTest (
    id INTEGER,
    name TEXT
);
```

Insert sample data into the table:

```sql
INSERT INTO TxTest VALUES
    (1, 'Friday'),
    (2, 'Phone');
```

### Inserting Data

Start a new transaction and insert a new row:

```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO TxTest VALUES (3, 'New one');
```

Rollback the transaction to undo the insertion:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

Now, start a new transaction and insert a new row with different data:

```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO TxTest VALUES (3, 'Vienna');
COMMIT;
```

### Deleting Data

Start a new transaction and delete a row:

```sql
BEGIN;
DELETE FROM TxTest WHERE id = 3;
ROLLBACK;
```

The deletion will be undone due to the rollback. To permanently delete the row, commit the transaction:

```sql
BEGIN;
DELETE FROM TxTest WHERE id = 3;
COMMIT;
```

### Updating Data

Start a new transaction and update a row:

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE TxTest SET name = 'Sunday' WHERE id = 1;
ROLLBACK;
```

The update will be undone due to the rollback. To permanently update the row, commit the transaction:

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE TxTest SET name = 'Sunday' WHERE id = 1;
COMMIT;
```
