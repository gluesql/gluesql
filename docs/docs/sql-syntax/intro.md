# SQL Syntax

Welcome to the Introduction page for the SQL Syntax category in GlueSQL! In this section, we'll provide a brief overview of the SQL syntax supported by GlueSQL. You can find more in-depth examples and details by browsing the other pages in this category.

GlueSQL is a SQL database engine written in Rust, designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to integrate with various data storage systems. It supports a wide range of SQL features, including creating and managing tables, inserting and updating data, and performing various types of queries.

Here's a list of some basic SQL statements you can use with GlueSQL:

## Creating Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_name1 data_type1,
    column_name2 data_type2,
    ...
);
```

## Inserting Data

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

## Selecting Data

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE conditions;
```

## Updating Data

```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE conditions;
```

## Deleting Data

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE conditions;
```

For a complete list of supported SQL features, you can visit the GlueSQL GitHub repository's test suite folder, even if you're not familiar with Rust code:
